## Sidewinder Algorithm

> Source: [Mazes for Programmers][REF1] by Jamis Buck

```sh
$ python sidewinder.py -h
usage: sidewinder.py [-h] [-d | -g] r c

positional arguments:
  r                    Number of rows
  c                    Number of columns

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -d, --distance_grid
  -g, --grid

$ python sidewinder.py -g 6 8
